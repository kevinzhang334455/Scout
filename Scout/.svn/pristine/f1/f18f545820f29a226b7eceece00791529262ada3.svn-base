
How to build Scout?

Quick install for Linux users
-----------------------------

Just run ./install.sh. It expects a boost library in the parent directory and 
it will check out and build llvm and clang there. Otherwise use the detailed instructions below.
Alternatively you can use install.sh as a reference and copy the lines step by step to your terminal. 

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Get Qt (tested version: 4.5, 4.6.1)
2. Get boost (see www.boost.org). Version 1.41 or later required.
3. Get llvm and clang (see llvm.org and clang.llvm.org) version 3.4. 
4. Optionally apply the patch ./clangAddons/patch/Scout.patch. 

On Linux:
cd $(LLVM_DIR)/tools/clang
patch -p0 < $(SCOUT_DIR)/clangAddons/patch/Scout.patch 

On Windows you can use the patch tool provided by TortoiseSVN.

You don't need to apply the patch. However it provides nice features:

4.1: the command-line option: -rewrite-style=[ANSI|KR]
The KR style is used by default and also without the patch. 

4.2: Comments are output with proper indentation.

4.3. Support of parsing pragma arguments



5. Build clang and llvm.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Linux Users have to call 

make REQUIRES_RTTI = 1 


6. Run configure.sh (configure.bat on Windows) from the Scout directory:

configure.[sh|bat] [-boost_dir=PATH] [-llvm_dir=PATH] [-llvm_lib_dir=PATH]

All PATHs may be absolute or relative.


7. Build the clangAddons:

cd $(SCOUT_DIR)/clangAddons
make  (on Linux)
cmake (on MAC and Windows)


8. Use $(SCOUT_DIR)/Scout.pro to build Scout using qt.

Ready.
